Student Performance Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Overview

This project presents an end-to-end exploratory data analysis of student performance data with the objective of identifying meaningful drivers of academic outcomes and translating findings into actionable business and academic decisions.

Rather than focusing solely on statistical outputs, this analysis emphasizes interpretation, structural validation, and decision relevance.

Objectives

Understand performance patterns across subjects and overall scores

Evaluate the role of demographics, behavior, and study practices

Identify which factors meaningfully explain performance variation

Avoid misleading conclusions based on averages alone

Translate data insights into practical recommendations

Dataset Description

The dataset includes aggregated and individual-level information on:

Academic performance

Overall score

Subject scores (Math, Science, English)

Behavioral factors

Study hours

Attendance percentage

Study method

Demographic and contextual factors

Gender, age

School type

Parents’ education

Internet access

Travel time

Extracurricular participation

Analysis Workflow

The analysis follows a structured workflow:

Data Validation

Category consistency checks

Joint frequency tables

Structural sanity checks

Univariate Analysis

Distribution of numeric variables

Variability assessment

Central tendency vs dispersion

Bivariate Analysis (Numeric vs Categorical)

Comparison of means and medians

Variance dominance assessment

Avoidance of causal assumptions

Categorical vs Categorical Analysis

Contingency tables

Modal category analysis

Structural balance and bias checks

Integrated Interpretation

Cross-subject synthesis

Business-focused conclusions

Clear articulation of what not to infer

Key Findings

Demographic variables show minimal impact on academic performance.

Behavioral factors (attendance and study hours) show strong alignment with outcomes.

Study method has a moderate but consistent influence, with structured approaches outperforming unstructured group study.

Most performance variation occurs at the individual level, not the group level.

Grades are internally consistent and align well with behavioral indicators.

Business & Academic Implications

Performance improvement strategies should focus on behavioral consistency, not demographic targeting.

Attendance and study routines are the most effective early indicators of risk.

Instructional design and learning structure are more impactful than access-based interventions.

Group-level segmentation is not supported by the data.
